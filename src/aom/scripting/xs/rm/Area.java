/**
 * <p>This class provides a collection of RM commands concerning Areas.</p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * Areas are regions on a map.
 * They are often irregular in shape, but can be rectangular as well.
 * Some areas are used for placing specific terrain, like a cliff or ocean, 
 * while others are just used as boundaries for other areas.
 * Special types of areas are player areas, which belong to a certain player, 
 * or team areas, which belong to a team.
 * Saying these areas "belong" is just a convenient method 
 * of making sure other areas or objects are placed in that area.
 * </p>

	 * Adds an area influence segment. You may want an area to grow towards specific points or lines.
	 * A circular area placed at the center of the map with an influence point of 1, 1 will produce a peninsula that protrudes towards 12 oâ€™clock. 
	 * Influence points and segments can be useful in getting areas, such as rivers, to extend beyond the edge of the map.

	 * Sometimes you may want an area to clean itself of objects, such as removing trees from ice.
	 * This will only work if the objects are already placed before the area, which is the reverse of how most ES maps are generated.
	 * You can reference specific units or abstract types, such as "unit" and "building."

	/**
	 * Adds a terrain layer to an area. Terrain layers allow you to place a border of one or more textures around an area.
	 * For example, you can have grassDirt50 and grassDirt75 around an area of grass. You can specify multiple layers for an area, 
	 * as long as the minDistance for one starts where the maxDistance for another leaves off. 
	 * Because different textures overlap one another you may need to experiment with distances to get a good effect.
	 * Here is an example:
	 * <code>
	 * rmSetAreaTerrainType(areaID, "GrassA");
	 * rmAddAreaTerrainLayer(areaID, "SnowGrass75", 13, 20);
	 * rmAddAreaTerrainLayer(areaID, "SnowGrass50", 6, 13);

	 * This command is most useful with connections, where you want to replace water with land where a connection goes across a river, or replace rock with snow for mountain passes.

	 * but if after 11 areas, area 12 still needs to be placed, it might have run out of space because the others were to greedy.
	 * To avoid this, build all player area's at the same time, so that the script can try to find a fair balance between all areas.
